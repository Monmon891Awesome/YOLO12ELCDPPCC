   - PUT /api/v1/patient/profile - Update profile

4. **Email Service** - Integrate SendGrid or AWS SES
5. **File Storage** - AWS S3 for scan images
6. **Security**:
   - HTTPS only
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection

### Optional Enhancements:

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Scans not saving?
- Check browser console for errors
