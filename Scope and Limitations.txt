2. LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 DATA-RELATED LIMITATIONS

L1: Dataset Size and Diversity
- The YOLOv12 model is trained on a finite dataset which may not represent all
  possible lung cancer presentations
- Geographic and demographic diversity of training data may be limited
- Rare cancer subtypes or atypical presentations may have insufficient training
  examples
- Impact: Potential for reduced accuracy on edge cases or underrepresented populations

L2: Image Quality Dependencies
- Performance is contingent on CT scan quality (resolution, contrast, artifacts)
- Low-quality or corrupted images may yield unreliable results
- Variation in scanning protocols across different machines affects consistency
- Impact: Results may vary based on imaging equipment and techniques used

L3: Annotation Accuracy
- Training data relies on human-annotated labels which may contain errors
- Inter-annotator variability can introduce inconsistencies
- Ground truth verification limited by available pathology confirmation
- Impact: Model may perpetuate or amplify human labeling errors

2.2 TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS

L4: Model Architecture Constraints
- YOLOv12 is optimized for speed but may sacrifice some accuracy vs. slower models
- Single-stage detection may miss very small nodules (<3mm)
- 2D image analysis does not fully utilize 3D spatial information from CT volumes
- Impact: Possible false negatives for early-stage, subtle lesions

L5: Classification Scope
- Limited to three primary cancer types plus normal tissue
- Does not detect benign conditions (infections, inflammation, fibrosis)
- Cannot differentiate between primary lung cancer and metastases
- No staging information (Stage I-IV) provided
- Impact: Clinical interpretation still requires radiologist expertise

L6: Processing Limitations
- Maximum file size restriction (100MB) may exclude high-resolution scans
- Batch processing limited to prevent server overload
- Real-time processing requires adequate computational resources (GPU preferred)
- Impact: Scalability concerns for high-volume clinical settings

L7: Integration Challenges
- Current implementation lacks integration with Picture Archiving and
  Communication Systems (PACS)
- No direct interface with Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Manual file upload required (no automated workflow)
- Impact: Additional steps needed for clinical adoption

2.3 FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS

L8: Authentication and Authorization
- Current authentication is mock/basic (not production-grade)
- No multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is simplified

- Impact: Security enhancements needed before clinical deployment

L9: Data Persistence
- Scan results currently stored in-memory (volatile)
- No long-term database implementation in development version
- Limited scalability for large patient populations
- Impact: Production deployment requires database integration

L10: Clinical Decision Support
- System provides preliminary analysis only, not final diagnosis
- Does not replace radiologist interpretation

- Business Associate Agreements (BAA) not in place
- Impact: Cannot be used with real patient data in U.S. healthcare settings
  without significant security enhancements

L14: Liability and Responsibility
- No established protocols for handling AI errors or misdiagnoses

- Lack of malpractice insurance coverage for AI-assisted diagnostics
- Impact: Legal and ethical considerations require clarification

L15: Explainability and Transparency
- Deep learning models function as "black boxes" with limited interpretability
