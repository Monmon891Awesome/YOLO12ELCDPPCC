STATEMENT OF PROBLEM AND HYPOTHESES
LungEvity: YOLOv12-Powered Lung Cancer Detection Platform
================================================================================

1. BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally,
with approximately 2.2 million new cases diagnosed annually. Early detection is
critical, as the 5-year survival rate for stage I lung cancer is approximately
60-70%, compared to less than 10% for stage IV. However, current diagnostic
methods face several challenges:

- Manual CT scan interpretation is time-consuming and subject to human error
- Radiologist workload continues to increase, leading to potential oversights
- Access to specialized radiologists is limited in rural and underserved areas
- Delayed diagnosis results in lower survival rates and increased treatment costs
- Patient-physician communication regarding scan results is often inefficient

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has shown
promising results in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Deep learning
models, particularly You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures, have demonstrated
superior performance in real-time object detection tasks.


2. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite advancements in medical imaging technology, three critical problems persist
in lung cancer detection and patient care management:

PROBLEM 1: Diagnostic Inefficiency
- Manual interpretation of CT scans is time-intensive (15-30 minutes per case)
- High inter-observer variability among radiologists (10-15% disagreement rate)
- Limited availability of specialized thoracic radiologists
- Delayed reporting leads to treatment postponement

PROBLEM 2: Detection Accuracy Limitations
- Small nodules (<5mm) are frequently missed in manual reviews
- Early-stage cancers may be misclassified as benign lesions
- Multiple cancer subtypes (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell
  carcinoma) require specialized expertise for accurate classification
- False positive rates remain high (20-30%), leading to unnecessary procedures

PROBLEM 3: Patient-Physician Communication Gap
- Patients lack immediate access to their scan results
- Complex medical terminology creates barriers to understanding
- Limited platforms for secure patient-physician consultation
- No centralized system for tracking scan history and follow-ups


3. OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL OBJECTIVE:
To develop and implement an AI-powered web-based platform for automated lung
cancer detection using YOLOv12 deep learning architecture, integrated with a
comprehensive patient-physician collaborative care system.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
1. To train and optimize a YOLOv12 model for detecting and classifying lung
   cancer subtypes (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma)
   from CT scan images

2. To develop a responsive web-based user interface that allows patients to upload
   CT scans and receive AI-powered analysis results in real-time

3. To implement a secure patient dashboard that displays:
   - AI-generated risk assessments (high, medium, low, none)
   - Detected abnormalities with bounding box visualizations
   - Confidence scores and recommended clinical actions
   - Historical scan records and trend analysis

4. To create a patient-physician communication platform that enables:
   - Secure sharing of scan results with healthcare providers
   - Appointment scheduling with specialists
   - Direct messaging between patients and doctors
   - Centralized medical record management

5. To evaluate the system's performance in terms of:
   - Detection accuracy (precision, recall, F1-score)
   - Processing speed (inference time per scan)
   - User experience and satisfaction
   - Clinical utility and integration feasibility


4. RESEARCH QUESTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RQ1: How accurately can a YOLOv12-based deep learning model detect and classify
     different lung cancer subtypes from CT scan images compared to traditional
     manual interpretation methods?

RQ2: What is the optimal configuration of YOLOv12 architecture (model size,
     confidence threshold, image preprocessing techniques) for achieving the
     highest detection accuracy while maintaining real-time processing speed?

RQ3: How does the integration of AI-powered analysis with a patient-physician
     communication platform impact the efficiency of diagnosis-to-treatment
     timeline compared to conventional workflows?

RQ4: What are the key factors affecting user acceptance and trust in AI-assisted
     diagnostic tools among both patients and healthcare providers?

RQ5: How can the system be designed to ensure data privacy, security, and
     compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)?
